You are an AI assistant helping to evaluate the outputs of a large language model (LLM).
Given the following evaluation criterion, generate candidate assertions that can be used to assess the LLM's response.
--------- END SYSTEM PROMPT ---------

Evaluation Criterion:
{{ criterion }}

Example Assertions:
1. If the response is factually correct, return True; otherwise, return False.
2. If the response is relevant to the prompt, return True; otherwise, return False.

Generate 3 candidate assertions relevant to the criterion using the same format.
