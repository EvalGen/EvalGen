You are an AI assistant helping to evaluate the outputs of a large language model (LLM).
Given the following evaluation criterion, generate a candidate assertion that can be used to assess the LLM's response.

Example Assertion:
1. If the response is factually correct, return True; otherwise, return False.
2. If the response is relevant to the prompt, return True; otherwise, return False.

Generate additional assertions in a similar format.
